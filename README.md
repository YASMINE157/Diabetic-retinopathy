# Diabetic Retinopathy

Overview
  
  Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that affects the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision impairment and potential blindness if left untreated. It is one of the most common complications of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss worldwide.
  
  Causes

  Diabetic retinopathy occurs due to prolonged high blood sugar levels, which damage the small blood vessels in the retina. Over time, these vessels may swell, leak, or become blocked, leading to vision problems.

Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy

    has no diabetic (no-DR)
    has diabetic (DR)

Symptoms

Blurred vision

Floaters (dark spots in vision)

Difficulty seeing at night

Sudden vision loss

Colors appearing faded or washed out

Diagnosis

Diabetic retinopathy is diagnosed through comprehensive eye examinations, including:

Dilated Eye Exam: To check for abnormal blood vessels, swelling, and bleeding.

Fluorescein Angiography: To identify leaking or blocked blood vessels.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): To capture detailed images of the retina and detect fluid buildup.

Treatment Options

Blood Sugar Control: Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels can slow disease progression.

Laser Therapy (Photocoagulation): Seals leaking blood vessels and prevents new vessel growth.

Intravitreal Injections: Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injections reduce swelling and abnormal blood vessel growth.

Vitrectomy: Surgical removal of blood and scar tissue from the eye in advanced cases.

AI in Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to automated screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. AI models, including deep learning-based approaches, analyze retinal images to detect abnormalities with high accuracy, enabling early diagnosis and timely intervention.

Conclusion

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious but preventable complication of diabetes. Early detection and appropriate management are crucial to preserving vision. AI-driven technologies offer promising solutions for large-scale screening and early diagnosis, improving patient outcomes globally.
